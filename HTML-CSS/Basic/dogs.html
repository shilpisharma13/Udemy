    <p>
      The <b>dog</b> or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus
      familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is
      characterized by an upturning tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern
      wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first
      species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years
      ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1]
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large
      number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a
      starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]
    </p>
    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his
      Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature).
      Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[15] and under this genus, he listed
      the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified the
      domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the
      grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate
      species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata),
      which is not found in any other canid.[16]
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years ago
      and brought an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first
      carnivorans.[20] The name carnivoran is given to a member of the order
      Carnivora. Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth called
      carnassials, in which the first lower molar and the last upper premolar
      possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair of shears for
      cutting meat.

    <h4 class="same-name">Domestication1</h4>
    <h5 class="same-name">Domestication2</h5>
    <p>
      This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past 60
      million years for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for
      the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and
      walruses. Today, not all carnivorans are carnivores, such as the
      insect-eating Aardwolf.[5]
